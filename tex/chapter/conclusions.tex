\chapter{Conclusions}
We have described a version of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Constraint Programming method. The nature of the problem is reducible to the combination between Travelling Salesman and Knapsack Problem. We have considered the \begin{math} circuit \end{math} global constraint to define the Hamiltonian property given by the Travelling Salesman modelling and the capacity symmetry breaking constraint from the Knapsack model. Furthermore, the model has been improved by an implied \begin{math}alldifferent\end{math} constraint but, adding some symmetry breaking constraint, the model decreased performance in terms of search. Finally, the search strategies have had problems in finding optimal solutions for instances with more than 100 customers. Moreover, they have been efficient in sequential cases and adding the Large Neighbourhood Strategy has given better results than the complete approach.
